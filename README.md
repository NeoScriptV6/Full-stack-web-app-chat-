## Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm is the core of Match-Me, designed to connect users based on their compatibility. Here's how it works:

1. **Biographical Data Points**:
   - The algorithm evaluates at least 5 key biographical data points:
     - Shared favorite games (highest weight).
     - Shared favorite genres.
     - Compatible gaming platforms.
     - Matching availability schedules.
     - Common interests or keywords.

2. **Proximity Filtering** (not enabbled, currently can connect any location):
   - Users are matched only if they are within a practical distance of each other.

3. **Scoring System**:
   - Each match is assigned a score based on the number of shared attributes.
   - Higher weights are given to more relevant data points (e.g., shared games and availability).
   - Matches are sorted by score, with the strongest matches appearing first.

4. **Dynamic Filtering**:
   - Users can dismiss recommendations, ensuring they are not shown again.
   - The algorithm dynamically adjusts to avoid weak recommendations.

5. **Limitations**:
   - A maximum of 10 recommendations is displayed at a time to keep the experience focused and manageable.

This algorithm ensures that users are presented with the most relevant and compatible matches, improving the likelihood of meaningful connections.
